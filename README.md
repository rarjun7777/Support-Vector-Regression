# SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION

Implemented SVR on position_salaries dataset 

# STEPS IN SVR

-> Importing the libraries

-> Importing the dataset

-> Feature Scaling

-> Training the SVR model on the whole dataset

-> Predicting a new result

-> Visualising the SVR results

-> Visualising the SVR results (for higher resolution and smoother curve)
